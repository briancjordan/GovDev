                <p>Agile development is a term that was derived from the Agile Manifesto, which was
                    written in 2001 by a group that included the creators of Scrum, Extreme Programming
                    (XP), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), and Crystal; a representative of
                    feature-driven development; and several other thought leaders in the software industry.
                    The Agile Manifesto established a common set of overarching values and principles
                    for all of the individual agile methodologies at the time. It details four core
                    values for enabling high-performing teams.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Individuals and their interactions</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Delivering working software</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Customer collaboration</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Responding to change</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These core values are supported by 12 principles, which you can find at the following
                    Web site: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=161241">Manifesto for Agile
                        Software Development</a>.</p>
                <p>These values are not just something the creators of the Agile Manifesto intended
                    to give lip service to and then forget. They are working values. Each individual
                    agile methodology approaches these values in a slightly different way, but all of
                    these methodologies have specific processes and practices that foster one or more
                    of these values. </p>

                <img id="sectionToggle0" class="toggle" name="toggleSwitch" src="../icons/collapse_all.gif" />Individuals
                and Interactions</span> </h1>
            <div id="sectionSection0" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style="">
                <p>Individuals and interactions are essential to high-performing teams. Studies of “communication
                    saturation” during one project showed that, when no communication problems exist,
                    teams can perform 50 times better than the industry average. To facilitate communication,
                    agile methods rely on frequent inspect-and-adapt cycles. These cycles can range
                    from every few minutes with pair programming, to every few hours with continuous
                    integration, to every day with a daily standup meeting, to every iteration with
                    a review and retrospective. </p>
                <p>Just increasing the frequency of feedback and communication, however, is not enough
                    to eliminate communication problems. These inspect-and-adapt cycles work well only
                    when team members exhibit several key behaviors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>respect for the worth of every person</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>truth in every communication</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>transparency of all data, actions, and decisions</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>trust that each person will support the team</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>commitment to the team and to the team’s goals</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To foster these types of behavior, agile management must provide a supportive environment,
                    team coaches must facilitate their inclusion, and team members must exhibit them.
                    Only then can teams achieve their full potential. </p>
                <p>Moving toward these types of behavior is more difficult than it might appear. Most
                    teams avoid truth, transparency, and trust because of cultural norms or past negative
                    experiences from conflict that was generated by honest communications. To combat
                    these tendencies, leadership and team members must facilitate positive conflict.
                    Doing so not only helps create productive behavior but also has several other benefits:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Process improvement depends on the team to generate a list of impediments or problems
                            in the organization, to face them squarely, and then to systematically eliminate
                            them in priority order.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Innovation occurs only with the free interchange of conflicting ideas, a phenomenon
                            that was studied and documented by Takeuchi and Nonaka, the godfathers of Scrum.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Aligning the team toward a common goal requires the team to surface and resolve conflicting
                            agendas.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Commitment to work together happens only when people agree on common goals and then
                            struggle to improve both personally and as a team.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This last bullet, about commitment, is especially important. It is only when individuals
                    and teams are committed that they feel accountable for delivering high value, which
                    is the bottom line for software development teams. Agile methodologies facilitate
                    commitment by encouraging teams to pull from a prioritized work list, manage their
                    own work, and focus on improving their work practices. This practice is the basis
                    of self-organization, which is the driving force for achieving results in an agile
                    team.</p>
                <p>To create high-performing teams, agile methodologies value individuals and interactions
                    over processes and tools. Practically speaking, all of the agile methodologies seek
                    to increase communication and collaboration through frequent inspect-and-adapt cycles.
                    However, these cycles work only when agile leaders encourage the positive conflict
                    that is needed to build a solid foundation of truth, transparency, trust, respect,
                    and commitment on their agile teams. </p>

            <div id="sectionSection1" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style="">
                <p>Working software is one of the big differences that agile development brings. All
                    of the agile methodologies that are represented in the Agile Manifesto stress delivering
                    small pieces of working software to the customer at set intervals. </p>
                <p>All agile teams must establish what they mean when they say “working software,” which
                    is frequently known as the definition of done. At a high level, a piece of functionality
                    is complete only when its features pass all tests and can be operated by an end
                    user. At a minimum, teams must go beyond the unit test level and test at the system
                    level. The best teams also include integration testing, performance testing, and
                    customer acceptance testing in their definition of what it means to be done with
                    a piece of functionality.</p>
                <p>One CMMI Level 5 company has shown, through extensive data on many projects, that
                    defining acceptance tests along with the feature, implementing features serially
                    and in priority order, immediately running acceptance tests on each feature, and
                    fixing any bugs that are identified as highest priority will systematically double
                    the speed of production and reduce defects by 40 percent. This from a company that
                    already has one of the lowest defect rates in the world.</p>
                <p>The Agile Manifesto recommends that teams deliver working software at set intervals.
                    Agreeing on a definition of done is one of the practical ways that agile teams bring
                    about the high performance and high quality that is needed to accomplish this goal.

            <div id="sectionSection2" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style="">
                <p>Over the past two decades, project success rates have more than doubled worldwide.
                    This is attributed to smaller projects and frequent deliveries, which allow the
                    customer to provide feedback on working software at regular intervals. The writers
                    of the manifesto were clearly on to something when they stressed that getting the
                    customer involved in the software development process is essential to success.
                </p>
                <p>The agile methodologies foster this value by having a customer advocate work hand-in-hand
                    with the development team. The first Scrum team, for example, had thousands of customers.
                    Because it was not feasible to involve them all in product development, they selected
                    a customer proxy, called a product owner, to represent not only all the customers
                    in the field, but also management, sales, support, client services, and other stakeholders.
                    The product owner was responsible for updating the list of requirements every four
                    weeks as the team released working software, taking into account the current reality
                    and actual feedback from customers and stakeholders. This allowed the customer to
                    help shape the software that was being created. </p>
                <p>The first XP team began with an internal IT project. They were able to have a company
                    end user on their team work with them daily. About 10 percent of the time, consultancies
                    and internal teams can find an end user who can work with the team on a day-to-day
                    basis. The other 90 percent of the time, they must appoint a proxy. This customer
                    proxy, whom XP teams call the customer, works with end users to provide a clear,
                    prioritized list of features for developers to implement.</p>
                <p>Collaborating with the customer (or customer proxy) on a daily basis is one of the
                    key reasons why industry data shows that agile projects have more than twice the
                    success rate of traditional projects on average worldwide. Agile methodologies recognize
                    this and, as such, have created a place on their development teams that is specifically
                    for the customer representative.</p>

                to Change over Following a Plan</span> </h1>
            <div id="sectionSection3" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style="">
                <p>Responding to change is essential for creating a product that will please the customer
                    and provide business value. Industry data shows that over 60 percent of product
                    or project requirements change during the development of software. Even when traditional
                    projects finish on time, on budget, with all features in the plan, customers are
                    often unhappy because what they find is not exactly what they wanted. “Humphrey’s
                    Law” says that customers never know what they want until they see working software.
                    If customers do not see working software until the end of a project, it is too late
                    to incorporate their feedback. Agile methodologies seek customer feedback throughout
                    the project so that they can incorporate feedback and new information as the product
                    is being developed. </p>
                <p>All agile methodologies have built-in processes to change their plans at regular
                    intervals based on feedback from the customer or customer proxy. Their plans are
                    designed to always deliver the highest business value first. Because 80 percent
                    of the value is in 20 percent of the features, well-run agile projects tend to finish
                    early, whereas most traditional projects finish late. As a result, customers are
                    happier, and developers enjoy their work more. Agile methodologies are based on
                    the knowledge that, in order to succeed, they must plan to change. That is why they
                    have established processes, such as reviews and retrospectives, that are specifically
                    designed to shift priorities regularly based on customer feedback and business value.

                is an Umbrella – Methodologies are Implementations</span> </h1>
            <div id="sectionSection4" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style="">
                <p>Agile development is not a methodology in itself. It is an umbrella term that describes
                    several agile methodologies. At the signing of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, these
                    methodologies included Scrum, XP, Crystal, FDD, and DSDM. Since then, Lean practices
                    have also emerged as a valuable agile methodology and so are included under the
                    agile development umbrella in the illustration later in this topic.</p>
                <p>Each agile methodology has a slightly different approach for implementing the core
                    values from the Agile Manifesto, just as many computer languages manifest the core
                    features of object-oriented programming in different ways. A recent survey shows
                    that about 50 percent of agile practitioners say that their team is doing Scrum.
                    Another 20 percent say that they are doing Scrum with XP components. An additional
                    12 percent say that they are doing XP alone. Because more than 80 percent of agile
                    implementations worldwide are Scrum or XP, GovDev for TFS 2010 v1.0
                    focuses on the core processes and practices of Scrum and XP.</p>
                <img alt="The Agile Umbrella" src="../art/TeamProj_AgileUmbrella.png" /><p>Scrum is
                    a framework for agile development processes. It does not include specific engineering
                    practices. Conversely, XP focuses on engineering practices but does not include
                    an overarching framework of development processes. That does not mean that Scrum
                    does not recommend certain engineering practices or that XP has no process. For
                    example, the first Scrum implemented all of the engineering practices that are now
                    known as XP. However, the Scrum framework for software development was designed
                    to get a team started in two or three days, whereas engineering practices often
                    take many months to implement. Therefore, it left the question of when (and whether)
                    to implement specific practices up to each team. Scrum co-creators Jeff Sutherland
                    and Ken Schwaber recommend that Scrum teams get started immediately and create a
                    list of impediments and a process improvement plan. As engineering practices are
                    identified as impediments, teams should look to XP practices as a way to improve.
                    The best teams run Scrum supplemented with XP practices. Scrum helps XP to scale,
                    and XP helps Scrum to work well.</p>
