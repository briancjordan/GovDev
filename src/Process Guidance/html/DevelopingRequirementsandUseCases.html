                <p>Requirements describe what the stakeholders expect from the product. You should express
                    your requirements in terms that allow them to be easily discussed with the business
                    stakeholders, using the vocabulary and concepts of the business domain. Requirements
                    should neither discuss nor depend on the implementation. Requirements include not
                    only the behavioral and quality of service expectations of the users but also statutory
                    constraints and commercial standards. </p>
                <p>By recording requirements in Visual Studio Team Foundation Server by using the requirements
                    work item, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Monitor progress toward implementing the requirements by linking them to use 
                            cases and associated task and test case work
                            items.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Structure the requirements into overall and more detailed use cases so that you
                            can manage them more easily and so that progress reports can summarize the information.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Model the requirements in Visual Studio Ultimate, linking model elements to requirements

                <p>The activities that are described in this topic, like any development activities,
                    should not be performed in strict order. Develop a domain model while you are writing
                    scenarios because one activity will help you improve the other activity. Develop
                    the use cases as the time for coding them approaches. Feed the experience with code
                    that has been written and demonstrated back to the scenarios that have yet to be
                    implemented.</p>

                <p>Team Foundation Server supports iterative working, and this practice is most effective
                    when the early iterations are used to gain feedback from prospective users and other
                    stakeholders. This feedback can be used to improve the requirements that have been
                    stated for future iterations. This results in a product that is much more effective
                    in its ultimate installation than a product that is developed over the same period
                    without any user trial. If your project is one component among many in a larger
                    program, early integration with other components allows the program architects to
                    improve the overall product.</p>
                <p>This flexibility must be balanced against the need to give firm commitments to your
                    customer or to partners in parallel projects. </p>
                <p>To a controlled extent, therefore, requirements are developed and refined throughout
                    the project. Because the detailed use cases are likely to change during the project,
                    determining them in full before the appropriate implementation is likely to result
                    in wasted effort.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>In Iteration 0, develop a set of requirements that describe of the main features, 
                            with just enough detail to form a project plan. The prodect plan assigns requirements
                            to use cases and use cases toiterations and states what requirement will be fulfilled at the end of each iteration.
                            Create a domain model of the major concepts and activities, and define the vocabulary
                            that will be used for those concepts both in discussion with the users and in the
                            implementation. Determine broad requirements that pervade every feature, such as
                            security and other quality of service requirements.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>At or near the start of each iteration, develop the use cases for those 
                            requirements
                            in more detail. Determine the steps that the users will follow, defining them with
                            the help of activity or sequence diagrams. Define what happens in exceptional cases.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Verify as often as possible all the requirements that have been implemented. Pervasive
                            requirements, such as security, must be verified with tests that are extended for
                            each new feature. If possible, automate the tests because automatic tests can be
                            performed continuously.</p>

                            <p>Do not change the use cases of requirements that are set for an iteration. In the 
                                rare case of an abrupt change in circumstances, you might have to cancel an 
                                iteration, review the project plan, and start a new iteration.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Look for uncertainties in the requirements. Try to arrange the plan so that user
                                experience with early iterations yields information that reduces the uncertainties.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Use change request work items to record requests to change behavior that has already
                                been implemented, unless the requested improvement is already part of the plan.
                                Link each change request to the appropriate requirement work items. For more information,

                                the impact of the request on dependent projects and users, and estimate the cost
                                with regard to changes in your code. If a change request is accepted, update the
                                requirement.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Designate a cut-off date (for example, after iteration 2 or 3) after which requirements
                                changes must be much more strongly justified. If your project is for a paying customer,
                                this is the date to have the customer approve a baseline set of requirements and
                                switch from hourly payment to fixed price.</p>

                <p>Create a UML model that describes the principal activities and concepts that are

                    <p>Although a scenario usually describes a specific sequence of events, an activity
                        diagram shows all the possibilities. Drawing an activity diagram can prompt you
                        to think about alternative sequences and to ask your business clients what should
                        happen in those cases.</p>
                    <p>The following illustration shows a simple example of an activity diagram.</p>

                        Where the interchange of messages is important, it might be more effective to use
                        a sequence diagram that includes a lifeline for each actor and major product component.
                    </p>
                    <p>Use case diagrams let you summarize the different flows of activity that your product
                        supports. Each node on the diagram represents a series of interactions between the
                        users and the application in pursuit of a particular user goal. You can also factor
                        common sequences and optional extensions into separate use case nodes. For more

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>Start by writing specific scenarios, which follow a particular set of actors through
                        a specific sequence. For example, "Carlos orders a pizza and garlic bread at the
                        DinnerNow Web site. The Web site redirects Carlos to Woodgrove Bank's payment service.
                        Fourth Coffee prepares the pizza and delivers it."</p>
                    <p>Specific scenarios help you envisage the system in use and are most useful when you
                        first explore a feature. </p>
                    <p>It can also be useful to create named personas that describe the backgrounds and
                        other activities of people and organizations. Carlos sleeps rough and uses an Internet
                        café; Wendy lives in a gated community; Sanjay orders meals for his wife at her
                        work; Contoso runs a chain of 2,000 restaurants worldwide; Fourth Coffee is run
                        by a couple who deliver by bicycle.</p>
                    <p>More generic scenarios that are written in terms of "a customer," "a menu item,"
                        and so on can be more convenient but are less likely to lead to the discovery of
                        useful features.</p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="subHeading">Levels of detail</h3>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>In Iteration 0, write a few important scenarios in some detail, but write most scenarios
                        in outline. When an iteration approaches in which a particular scenario is to be
                        fully or partly implemented, add more detail.</p>
                    <p>When you first consider a scenario, it can be useful to describe the business context,
                        even aspects in which the product takes no part. For example, describe the DinnerNow
                        method of delivery: Does each restaurant organize its own deliveries, or does DinnerNow
                        run a delivery service? The answers to such questions provide useful context for
                        the development team.</p>
                    <p>The more detailed scenarios that you develop at the start of an iteration can describe
                        user interface interactions, and storyboards can show user interface layout.
