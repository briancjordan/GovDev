                    The team selects Use Cases at the start of the sprint, collaborates to implement
                    and test the Use Cases during the sprint, and presents the finished software

                    its work. The team is cross-functional because it contains the skills that it requires

                <h3 class="subHeading">What Makes a Good Team</h3>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>A good software team is difficult to assemble and takes time to build. Examples of
                        good teams are all around us: surgical teams, basketball teams, and sheepdogs and
                        their handlers. Each team member may have his or her specialty, but the team works
                        together and succeeds or fails together.</p>
                    <p>Good software teams are also composed of individuals who pull together toward a common
                        goal. A software team should not be just a collection of experts, each of whom takes
                        a turn performing only the tasks in which they specialize. Instead, a team should
                        be a group of people whose collective skills and expertise outweigh the skill of
                        any individual. Through collaboration, communication, trust, and openness, a team
                        can deliver success and grow beyond the individual capabilities of its members to
                        become a high-performing unit.</p>
                    <p>A good team has the people and skills that are required to deliver working software.
                        The full-time members of the team should have most or all skills that are required
                        to fulfill the project. Specialized individuals such as designers, operations people,
                        architects, or experts in a specific technology might not be available full time.
                        The team can pull in external specialists for short-term activities. However, full-time
                        team members should comprise people who can cover most of the skills that are required
                        to complete the work.</p>

                <h3 class="subHeading">Team Core Responsibilities</h3>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>The primary responsibility of the team is to create software that meets both customer
                        expectations and the team's criteria for finished software. The team's responsibilities
                        start at the sprint planning meeting and end at the sprint review meeting. At the
                        sprint planning meeting, the team divides Use Cases into tasks. At the sprint
                        review meeting, the team presents working software to the product owner and possibly
                        customers.</p>
                    <p>The team is also responsible for its own results. The team manages itself in defining
                        and completing the work that it has selected and in collaborating among team members
                        to optimize team effectiveness. The team should always work to improve its results
                        by engaging in the following activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Define criteria for what is finished, and finish each task before starting the next.

                <p>As a ScrumMaster, you are responsible for building and maintaining a healthy team

                <h3 class="subHeading">What Makes a Good ScrumMaster</h3>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>To be a good ScrumMaster, you should possess or build excellent communication, negotiation,
                        and conflict resolution skills. You will use these skills daily to help your team
                        develop. You must actively listen to not only the words that people say and write
                        but also how they deliver their messages (their body language, facial expressions,
                        vocal pace, and other nonverbal communication). You should ask questions that reveal
                        hidden issues and confirm what you have understood people say. You should use these
                        skills to identify potential issues on the team and help prevent them from becoming
                        actual issues. It is cheaper to fix a bug soon after it is discovered, and it is
                        easier and less disruptive to fix a team issue when it is small and manageable than
                        when it is large and out of control. You should make the team, the product owner,
                        and the other business stakeholders feel at ease as you drive the team to significantly
                        increase its productivity. You should gather, analyze, and present data to the business
                        stakeholders in a way that demonstrates how the team is improving and growing. For
                        example, if your team has significantly increased the amount of value that it has
                        delivered while generating fewer bugs, you must show that improvement to the business
                        stakeholders.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>Your primary responsibility is to make sure that the team and the product owner follow
                        the Scrum processes. For example, you should not let the daily Scrum meeting become
                        an open discussion that lasts 45 minutes. You will also make sure that the product
                        owner does not ask the team to add work to a sprint after it starts. You will prevent
                        the team from presenting Use Cases in the sprint review meeting if those use cases
                        are not completely finished.</p>
                    <p>You will help clear blocking issues that the team may encounter. You might need to
                        perform small tasks, such as approving a purchase order for a new build computer,
                        or perform larger, more challenging tasks, such as resolving conflicts among members
                        of your team. When the team engages in painful interaction, you must help the team
                        to recover and work more effectively in the future.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>You must analyze customer requirements and articulate them as Use Cases. You must
                        have good negotiation skills so that you can help customers to understand the tradeoffs
                        between requested features and the impact that they have on the schedule. You must
                        work with customers to prioritize the product backlog so that the team produces
                        the most valuable product or system, one increment at a time. You must have subject-matter
                        expertise in the business area or industry of the system that is being built. For
                        example, you must have a background in healthcare and healthcare insurance if your
                        team is building a healthcare system for a hospital. Without this knowledge, you
                        cannot effectively prioritize the product backlog or explain the product backlog
                        items to the team. You will also benefit from basic financial skills, such as the
                        ability to understand the payback period on a system, budget amortization, and capital
                        and expense budgeting. Your understanding of the Scrum processes and your commitment
                        to them is also important to the success of the team.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>Your core responsibilities are to represent customer and stakeholder requirements
                        to the team, and to respond to the questions from the team. You must keep the product
                        backlog current and prioritized. To maintain the product backlog, you must communicate
                        regularly with customers, stakeholders, and the team. You should meet with stakeholders
                        at least every one to two weeks. The order in which Use Cases are implemented
                        will affect the payback period and the amount of work that the team must perform.
                        The team will help you to understand how the sequence of Use Cases affects the
                        work. You must help the stakeholders understand the effects of these ranking decisions.
                        You also reduce the need for detailed specifications by being available to team
                        members when they have questions about how to implement functionality. To keep the
                        team moving, you must have these answers or be able to find them very quickly (in
                        a few hours). If you are unavailable, team results will suffer.</p>

                                        elaborated Use Cases and open lines of communication are the most effective specifications.
                                        However, an application that processes lab tests might require detailed specifications
                                        so that the team can analyze in more detail the impact of changes that they make
