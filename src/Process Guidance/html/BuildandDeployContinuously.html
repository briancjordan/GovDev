                <p>When many developers collaborate on complex software projects, it can be a long and
                    unpredictable process to integrate different parts of code together. However, you
                    can make this process more efficient and more reliable if you build and deploy your
                    project continuously.</p>
                <p>Continuous integration (CI) is the process of integrating your code into a shared
                    repository as frequently as possible. During code integration, a build break or
                    a test failure can inform you, in a timely manner, of an error in your code.
                </p>
                <p>Martin Fowler has the following breakdown of practices for continuous integration:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Maintain a single source repository.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Automate the build.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Make your build self-sustaining.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Check in at least once a day.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Build each check-in on the CI server.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Keep the build fast.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Test in a clone of the production environment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Make it easy for anyone to get the most recent executable.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Always be aware of what is happening.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Automate deployment.</p>

                    Continuous Integration</a>. </p>
                <p>Visual Studio Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) helps you manage the end-to-end
                    process of software development and supports the practice of continuous integration.
                    By leveraging the capabilities of Visual Studio ALM, your project can avoid unexpected
                    delays, cost overruns, and execution risks.</p>

                Dependencies</span> </h1>
            <div id="sectionSection0" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style="">
                <p>Integrating code is a complex process because of the dependencies among code. For
                    example, a library that draws a circle on a screen depends on the Sqrt() method
                    of the system math libraries. If the Sqrt() method changes, you must update the
                    library accordingly. Hardware and operating systems change much less frequently
                    than your team project. However, ignoring changes under any circumstances can lead
                    to disastrous results. You can integrate your code as early as possible to examine
                    whether it is based on valid assumptions and whether it works as planned.</p>
                <p>Changes in code can affect dependencies differently. The following illustration shows
                    two situations. The example on the left shows a relatively isolated change. However,
                    the example on the right shows a change with more potential impact because there
                    are many dependencies on it.</p>
                <img alt="Build and Deploy Code Diagram" src="../art/BD_ContinuouslyCode.png" /><p>The
                    following illustration shows how constant changes can have compound effects if you
                    do not integrate and upgrade your code continuously.</p>
                <img alt="Continuous Build and Deploy Code Timeline" src="../art/BD_CodeDiagram.png" /><p>
                    In step 1, you change code block h, which potentially affects all depending code
                    blocks a, b, d, e, and f. In step 2, you change both code blocks a and b. If the
                    team does not integrate between steps 1 and 2, blocks a and b might no longer be
                    valid. In step 3, you change code block f. Assuming the team does not integrate
                    between steps 2 and 3, code block b at this point has been affected, changed, and
                    affected again. As a result, code block b can become challenging to fix.</p>

            <div id="sectionSection1" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style="">
                <p>Visual Studio ALM provides integrated toolsets to support continuous integration.
                    As the following illustration shows, these tools include version control, build,
                    test, deployment to a lab environment, work item tracking, and the data warehousing
                    functionality.</p>
                <img alt="TFS in Continuous Build and Deploy" src="../art/BD_TFS.png" /><p>First, you
                    can use Team Foundation version control to manage branches, changesets, and the
                    integration between them. Each team member can use workspaces to work independently.
                    For more information, see <span sdata="link"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d74122a4-6a3d-45fb-82b7-3c1494ed4afd">
                        Branching and Merging</a></span>  and <span sdata="link"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1d7f6ed8-ec7c-48f8-86da-9aea55a90d5a">
                            Set Up your Development Machine to Work with your Team's Project</a></span>.</p>
                <p>Second, you can use Team Foundation Build to compile, test, and deploy your software
                    in an automated and distributed system. As the previous illustration shows, Team
                    Foundation Build has two kinds of builds. One kind uses a continuous build type
                    to build the development branch. The other kind uses a gated check-in build type
                    to build the Main branch. Visual Studio Team Foundation Server supports five types
                    of builds: manual, continuous (triggered by every check-in), rolling (accumulate
                    check-ins until the previous build finishes), gated check-in, and scheduled. For
                    more information, see <span sdata="link"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1c2eca2d-9a65-477e-9b23-0678ff7882ee">
                        Create a Basic Build Definition</a></span>, <span sdata="link"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8062e877-6824-44e3-b65c-dfcbbc97c206">
                            Understanding a Team Foundation Build System</a></span>, and <span sdata="link"><a
                                href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/28fabf92-d3e0-43bb-96b5-7e5c10baa336">Check
                                In Pending Changes that Are Controlled by a Gated Check-in Build</a>
                    </span>. </p>
                <p>Third, lab management capabilities of Visual Studio ALM help define and deploy builds
                    to both physical and virtual lab environments. To catch integration errors at runtime
                    in a specific environment, you can deploy a build to a lab environment and then
                    run test suites on this build. For more information, see <span sdata="link"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b435eb39-dc7c-46fa-a91b-6e6dd614f01c">
                        Using a Virtual Lab for Your Application Lifecycle</a></span>.</p>
                <p>In addition, test capabilities in Visual Studio ALM are available on your team members'
                    machines, on the build machine, and inside the lab environment. First, running test
                    suites on the developer’s machine catches problems with the code that has been recently
                    changed or created. Second, running tests on the build machine catches problems
                    that relate to integration with other code. Third, running tests in the lab catches
                    problems that relate to the variance in different environments. For more information,
                    see <span sdata="link"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/32acfeb1-b1aa-4afb-8cfe-cc209e6183fd">

                <p>Fourth, Visual Studio Team Foundation Server is the repository that stores work items.
                    You can create, manage, and track work items, such as bugs or tasks, that are assigned
                    to your team members. If a build breaks during code integration, your team must
                    fix the problem as soon as possible. You can configure Team Foundation Server to
                    create work items for build breaks. For more information, see <span sdata="link"><a
                        href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d2d8637d-0ef8-4ca3-874e-a04713344032">Tracking
                        Bugs, Tasks, and Other Work Items</a></span>. </p>
                <p>Last, the databases of the warehouse for Team Foundation Server and for SQL Server
                    Analysis Services aggregate and relate all the data that is provided by subsystems
                    in Team Foundation Server. These subsystems include version control, build, test,
                    deployment, and work item tracking. Therefore, your team can visualize the end-to-end
                    process of continuous integration. For more information, see <span sdata="link"><a

                            an appropriate test suite, create a placeholder test suite and import a few automated
                            test cases. This suite can serve as a placeholder for future tests.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensure that you deliver the resulting binaries from a build to a shared location.
                            This strategy can help you diagnose problems that appear during testing.</p>

                <p>A version control system provides a shared repository to your code. A small team

                    feasible because you usually must develop multiple versions of code and release
                    your project in different milestones. For more information about how to create and

                <p>In continuous integration, a build system generates the executable components that
                    can be tested and deployed. A build system also provides feedback in the form of
                    compilation errors and warnings. These errors are caused by changes that are introduced
                    into your project source.</p>

                    <p>Your team members must organize their sources so that they take no longer than 10
                        minutes to build. For larger projects, this frequency might not be possible. By
                        using Team Foundation Server, your team can configure various build definitions
                        that build different subsets of the code base. If builds take a long time, you can
                        use a rolling build type to continuously generate binaries for the unchanged code.
                    </p>
                    <p>If and when a build breaks, your team must fix the build immediately. Assuming that
                        the main branch does not get affected by a bad reverse integration, most build breaks
                        are either from a bad check-in at a work branch or a forward integration from the
                        mainline branch. It is a good idea to assign the task of fixing build breaks to
                        a team member for a period of time and then to rotate this assignment among members
                        of your team.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>The following illustration shows how the features of testing and deployment in Visual
                        Studio ALM fit into continuous integration.</p>
                    <img alt="Fit testing into continuous integration" src="../art/BD_Lab.png" /><p>First,
                        when you integrate your code continuously, you can find problems with the code from
                        the build itself. The build either succeeded or did not compile, given the compiler
                        that you used. You can generate a build report that contains both error and warning
                        messages from the compiler. In Visual Studio ALM, the build report also provides
                        information such as which bugs were fixed in this build, which changesets were included
                        in this build, and whether code analysis was run during the build. By using Visual
                        Studio ALM, you can verify whether the design of your code follows the rules that
                        your team defines. For more information, see <span sdata="link"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/70cbe55d-4b33-4355-b0a7-88c770a6f75c">

                    <p>Second, you can find problems with your code by running unit tests. These tests diagnose
                        problems differently from compilers. The rules of the compiler check problems with
                        code syntax and language constructs. In contrast, the unit tests (which can run
                        on a build after it is completed) can verify any functional aspect of the code.
                        These unit tests can also provide metrics such as code coverage on a build, given
                        a set of unit tests. For more information, see <span sdata="link"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8dcf94f8-8b85-41ba-a5a2-d12aa5d2da85">

                    <p>By using Microsoft Test Manager, you can configure a set of environments in which
                        you can run tests. Isolated unit tests can provide a level of functional verification.
                        However, environments have the following important aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Varying environments can affect how code works. For example, network settings and
                                topology might be difficult to test without a lab management environment. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Automating code deployment in a specific environment helps your team decrease deployment
                                time and increase the number of deployment iterations. </p>
